Tomasolu algorithm is a very important hardware technique for dynamic scheduling of instructions.

1. Key concepts of Tomasolu algorithm:  
  - Tracking dependences to allow instructions execute as soon as operands are available, avoiding RAW hazards.  
  - Register renaming to avoid WAR and WAW hazards.
